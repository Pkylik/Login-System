# Login-System
This is a console application that uses files to create a mimic of a log in and sign up system. This was just created for fun

After using Log in or Sign up functions, the whole code restarts to the start where you choose between Log in and Sign up.

**DISCLAIMER: This was just a fun thing to create in like a few hours. I will not be held accountable if you use this for an actual security measure, non of this code is meant to be secure, just functional.**
