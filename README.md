# Login-System
This is a console application that uses files to create a mimic of a log in and sign up system. This was just created for fun

**DISCLAIMER: This was just a fun thing to create in like a few hours. I will not be held accountable if you use this for an actual security measure, none of this code is meant to be secure, just functional.**

# How to compile it
Just get .NET Framework 4.8 and compile
